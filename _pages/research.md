## üß† Research Interests

I explore intersections of quantum computing, photonics, remote sensing, and embedded systems ‚Äî with active contributions in:

- **Nanofabrication & SPC diagnostics** via AggieFab Facility  
- **Optical ocean surface analysis** using drones and wave detection algorithms  
- **Semiconductor device modeling** and lithography techniques  
- **Lunar robotics & sensor integration** in collaboration with NASA-modeled simulations  
- **Sensor-driven hardware** such as autonomous UAVs, Koala Moon Bot, and SensorCath

## üåç Ongoing Projects

- RESTORE initiative: Developing low-cost remote sensing platforms for coastal monitoring  
- Algorithmic matching tool for cadet academic tutoring ‚Äî deployed in honor society leadership  
- SEC Alumni Hub database and MERN stack integration  
- Multi-modal sensor fusion for drone flight stability and marine characterization

## ü§ù Collaborations

- Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station  
- NOAA & TXGLO  
- Aerospace Technology Research & Operations Center (ASTRO)  
- Corps of Cadets & General Ormond R. Simpson Honor Society  
- International Student Association & Student Engineers‚Äô Council

If you want to auto-populate this section from a research collection or break each project out into dedicated pages, I can help build it modularly. Want to link this from your homepage too?
